Time series data with admin1 level COVID-19 case/deaths data in Ecuador.
Source: Ecuador's National Service for Risk and Emergency Management 
Dates: 03/21/2020 - 08/20/2020

Data is presented here https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/informes-de-situacion-covid-19-desde-el-13-de-marzo-del-2020/
as a series of pdf infographics. Data was either copy and pasted or manually entered from the first table in each PDF containing admin1 case data.
Sometimes deaths data is not included - so deaths data is incomplete for some days. Case data should be accurate though. 

This dataset was created by Patrick Hinson working under the University of Virginia's School of Medicine.
